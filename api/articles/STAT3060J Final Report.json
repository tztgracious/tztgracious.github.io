Other than the local pharmacies, hospitals, and online shopping, local fever clinics also play a crucial role in supplying fever medicine to the locals. So what amount of fever medicine these clinics should store beforehand remains an important issue. </p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Introduction-Method\"><a href=\"#Introduction-Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Introduction Method\"></a>Introduction Method</h2><p>Given this situation and that the course is in cooperation with the Jingshan Community in Fuzhou City, our team decide to focus on researching the supply and demand of fever medicine in one community based on the questionnaires we’ve collected in order to predict the proportion of medicine that’s required for the four fever clinics in the community. With the information collected from the surveys, we strive to apply data visualization methods like charts and heat maps to get a clear and intuitive understanding of the degree to which different regions in the community need the fever medicine. The results and analysis will be detailed in the next section.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Result-amp-Analysis\"><a href=\"#Result-amp-Analysis\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Result &amp; Analysis\"></a>Result &amp; Analysis</h2><hr>\n<h2 id=\"Discussion\"><a href=\"#Discussion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Discussion\"></a>Discussion</h2><hr>\n<h2 id=\"Acknowledgments\"><a href=\"#Acknowledgments\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Acknowledgments\"></a>Acknowledgments</h2><p>We strongly appreciate Prof. Ailin Zhang for teaching us basic skills and advanced knowledge about <strong>data manipulation, visualization, and GitHub Pages deployment</strong>.
