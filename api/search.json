Other than the local pharmacies, hospitals, and online shopping, local fever clinics also play a crucial role in supplying fever medicine to the locals. So what amount of fever medicine these clinics should store beforehand remains an important issue. \n\nIntroduction MethodGiven this situation and that the course is in cooperation with the Jingshan Community in Fuzhou City, our team decide to focus on researching the supply and demand of fever medicine in one community based on the questionnaires we’ve collected and predict the proportion of medicine that’s required for the four fever clinics in the community.\n\nResult Analysis\nDiscussion\nAcknowledgmentsWe strongly appreciate Prof. Ailin Zhang for teaching us basic skills and advanced knowledge about data manipulation, visualization, and GitHub Pages deployment. What’s more, special thanks are also expressed to our fellows who help us promote our surveys and to locals who devote their time to this survey. Wish all of you a happy New Year!  \n","slug":"STAT3060J Final Report","date":"2023-01-08T16:59:20.439Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"","author_index":"tztgracious"},{"id":"f73a8e23e6f6f669cf99c7dba8fa0722","title":"","content":"What’s wrong with you?","slug":"test2","date":"2023-01-08T12:56:04.827Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"","author_index":"tztgracious"},{"id":"f73a8e23e6f6f669cf99c7dba8fa0722","title":"","content":"只因你实在是太美","slug":"test","date":"2023-01-08T12:56:00.327Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"","author_index":"tztgracious"},{"id":"13cb3d6db80ac71234ac4daca906cbff","title":"WOWOWOW","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
