In the new challenging circumstance, it’s undoubted that the residents in the community will try their best to store as much necessary medicine as possible. Major sources of medicine are local pharmacies, hospitals, and online shopping. Beside these sources, local fever clinics also play an important role in the supply of COVID medicines with ingredients like Ibuprofen and acetaminophen that are proven to be very useful to overcome fever symptom. Based on our survey, at the peak stage of the pendamic, there is a major deficit of these two kinds of medicines, comparing to other compound prescriptions like “999 cold spirit”. \nTargeting at this problem, our team conduct a survey on residents’ needs of these medecines and aim to quantitively measure the gap between the demand and the supply of these “fever medicines” at the peak stage of each pendamic wave, so that the Jinshan sub-district(the place where we conduct our experiment) can have a better estimation of how much medicine should be prepared in each of its affiliated fever clinic in order to handle the vast demand.\n\nAnalysis on Questionnaire\n\n\n\n\nBy applying NumPy and Pandas methods, we clean the data set collected from the questionnaires. Then we easily manipulate the data and get the pie chart above indicating the proportion of the number of home residents. As we can infer from the figure, the number of 4 household people occupies the most proportion, reaching 27.5%. The number of 5 and 3 approximate the top, reaching 23.5% and 20.3% respectively.\nThe results imply that the size of most families in the Jinshan Subdistrict falls into the scope from 3 to 5. Furthermore, from the dynamic chart, we can infer that a large proportion of these kinds of families have either kids or elders. The proportion of elders and kids in all the families, 0.4860 and 0.3245 respectively, will be used later in calculating the need for fever medicine.\n\n\n\nWhen asking the survey takers whether they'd heard of the free medicine delivery, 78.4% of them respond that they'd never heard of it. While 19% of them have known it before without participation and only a proportion of 2.61% have known it with participation. To our surprise, we find out that the community actually has promoted this activity well, as the total ratio of people acknowledging it is over 21%. We reckon that time conflicts, unawareness of the activity time, and already enough fever medicine storage all contribute to the small proportion participating in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart above illustrates the tendency to get fever medicine from different places. The discussion part will detail it later.\nBased on our previou discussions, we’ve successfully estimated the potential need when the pendamic reaches peak value. Actually, there’s more to do. Further research on this topic can be of various perspectives. \nFirst, we may transfer the estimation of the peak need into a complete respond plan in the future. The following is the trend of infection in Japan in the past three years. \n日本感染图片\nSince January, 2022, the emerge of omicron variant of COVID-19 has caused the third and forth peak infection periods. This can actually serve as a good forecast of the future trend in China. The new infection wave in Japan happens recently, and we notice that the peak infection number has doubled since the last trend. Although this could be the result of a series of reasons, it’s almost certain that the pendemic won’t vanish instantly, but is likely to come in trends in the future. People’s antigen for COVID will not be as efficient as it is several months ago, which is likely to cause the continuous emergence of new infection. If we can estimate the distribution of infection over a period of time, we can plan how many packs of medicine we need for each period of time in the infection wave.\nAlso, more detailed survey about demographic information and the level of emergency in each community in Jingshan sub-district can provide a better estimation of the demand. As we’re still undergoing the first infection wave, we lack enough time to conduct a more thorough survey for comprehensive analysis. We’ve also seen in the questionnaire that most residents are still unfamiliar with the free medicine giveaway activity, which also proves that local fever clinics lack enough attention. As stated in the questionnaire, many of the residents are willing to get the medicine at local clinics if they have enough supply, which can greatly relieve the pressure of big hospitals. For most residents with mild symptoms, clinics can become the top option for them.\n\nIntroduction MethodThe following table demonstrates some symbols and their meanings that will be used later.\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n  \n    Symbol\n    Meaning\n  \n\n\n  \n    D\n    total demand of fever medicines\n  \n  \n    \n    infected population in age group\n  \n  \n    \n    personal demand in age group\n  \n  \n    \n    infection duration in age group\n  \n  \n    \n    daily personal demand in age group\n  \n  \n    P\n    total population in subdistrict\n  \n  \n    \n    infection rate\n  \n  \n    \n    fever symptom duration rate\n  \n  \n    \n    population distribution of age groups\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to better model the problem, our team make the following assumptions:\n\nThe demographic distribution(the proportion of residents of each age range) is identical throughout various neighboorhoods within the whole Jinshan sub-district. This should be valid as it is not very large and shouldn’t have major difference within the sub-district.\nWhen fever symptom appears, people take fever medicine with ingredients of Ibuprofen or acetaminophen of the same brand. Each pack consists of 24 pills. People take the medicine according to the guidance that adults and the elders take two pills per day and children take one pill per day. This assumption is to ensure that we can quantitively measure how many “packs” of medicine are needed without losing generalizability. Our model can be easily adjusted to different kinds of medicines with minor modifications in calculation.\n\nTo calculate the total demand in the sub-district, we classify the resident into children, adults and the elders according to their ages, and then obtain their need of the medicines respectively. A complete demonstation of our model is below:\n\n\nWe first present how we calculate each part of the model, then wrap up the result in the next section.\nInfected Population in each Age GroupFrom the demographic information provided by WenXuJinShan(问需金山) WeChat Official Account, we can calculate the total population in Jinshan Subdistrict. Based on the survey (), the peak infection rate in an area is 63\\%. We multiply these two variables with corresponding age distribution proportion achieved through our questionaires to get the total infected population in this age group:\n\nConsumption per PatientBased on [], the total disease course of patients in each age group is:\nMeanwhile, the proportion of fever symptom duration within the total course is 21.2\\% by [].We multiply these two variables with the amount of medicines taken by a person of the given age group in our assumption, we achieve the medicine demand of a single patient during the whole course of disease:\n\nFinal ResultFinally, we have access to the peak demand of fever medicine for each age group by multiplying infected popultion and medicine need of one patient calculated in previous procedures. We then add up the results of three age groups together to achieve the peak demand of number of packs of fever medicine in Jinshan Subdistrict.\n\nWe strive to apply data visualization methods like charts and heat maps to get a clear and intuitive understanding of the degree to which different regions in the community need the fever medicine. The results and analysis will be detailed in the next section.\n\nResult &amp; AnalysisThe fight with COVID is a long-term journey. Our team sincerely hope that our project can serve as an inspiration of some potential actions for the Jingshan sub-district, and wish that we can all overcome this challenge.\n\nDiscussion\nAcknowledgmentsWe strongly appreciate Prof. Ailin Zhang for teaching us basic skills and advanced knowledge about data manipulation, visualization, and GitHub Pages deployment.
