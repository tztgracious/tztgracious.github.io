In the new challenging circumstance, it’s undoubted that the residents in the community will try their best to store as much necessary fever medicine as possible. Major sources of medicine are local pharmacies, hospitals, and online shopping. Beside these sources, local fever clinics also play an important role in the supply of COVID medicines with ingredients like Ibuprofen and acetaminophen that are proven to be very useful to overcome fever symptom. A deficit in these two kinds of medicine will cause severe problems and panics within the residents.\n\nPopulation Heatmap of Jinshan Sub-district\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeting at this problem, our team conduct a survey on residents’ needs of these medecines and aim to quantitively measure the gap between the demand and the supply of these “fever medicines” at the peak stage of each pendamic wave, so that the Jinshan sub-district(the place where we conduct our experiment) can have a better estimation of how much medicine should be prepared in each of its affiliated fever clinic in order to handle the vast demand.\n\nAnalysis on QuestionnaireBased on the question we define, we conduct a questionnaire survey on the demographic characteristics and people’s medicine purchase habit in Jingshan sub-district. During the five-day survey, we collected a total of 170 effective samples. Now we present some of the major statistics results we concluded from the questionnaire.\nFamily size inquiry and kid/elder ratio\n\n\n\n\nBy applying NumPy and Pandas methods, we clean the data set collected from the questionnaires. Then we easily manipulate the data and get the bar chart above indicating the distribution of the household number. As we can infer from the figure, the number of 4 household people occupies the most proportion. The number of 5,3 and 6 rank after it sequentially.\n\n\n\n\nThe results imply that the size of most families in the Jinshan Subdistrict falls into the scope from 3 to 6. Furthermore, from the dynamic chart, we can infer that a large proportion of these kinds of families have either kids or elders. The proportion of elders and kids in all the families, 0.2507 and 0.2973 respectively, will be used later in calculating the need for fever medicine.\nAwareness of free drug delivery and options to get fever medicine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asking the survey takers whether they’d heard of the free medicine delivery, 78.8% of them respond that they’d never heard of it. While 18.8% of them have known it before without participation and only a proportion of 2.35% have known it with participation. To our surprise, we find out that the community actually has promoted this activity well, as the total ratio of people acknowledging it is over 21%. We reckon that time conflicts, unawareness of the activity time, and already enough fever medicine storage all contribute to the small proportion participating in it.\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart above illustrates the tendency to get fever medicine from different places. The discussion part will detail it later.\nField Trip ResultTo investigate the actual supply ability in the region, we visited five pharmacies to survey their supply ability of various types of fever medicine in the infection wave.d As most of the pharmacies cannot provide detail data about their saling circumstance, we summarize the information w get in describtive language:\n\nMost pharmacies don’t have strict statistics on numbers of pack saled in a period of time, they just replenish periodically and sale whenever there is medicine remaining.\nPharmacies usually have sufficient supply in compound medicine for cold like “999 cold spirit” even in peak infection period, while the important fever medicine with ingredients of Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are usually sold out for a long period of time in the infection wave.\nBased on the estimation of pharmacy salespeople, many people are used to storing the medicine even if they don’t need them currently. \nSalespeople estimted that the infection peak occured in Fuzhou city occured rougly at the middle of December. Previously mentioned medicine had been sold out even one week before that.\nOne salesperson at a pharmacy estimated that they sold rougly 100-200 packs during the infection wave before the medicine were sold out.\n\nThe result from both the questionnaire and the field trip meet our expectations. We can conclude that most people have the demand of extra medicine in the infection wave, and there’s a deficit of medicine in pharmacies. As pharmacy’s medicine replenishment is almost constant over time(they don’t get as much extra support as government-owned clinics and hospitals during infection wave), our assumed problem is actually real and worth investigating.\n\nIntroduction MethodThe following table demonstrates some symbols and their meanings that will be used later.\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n  \n    Symbol\n    Meaning\n  \n\n\n  \n    D\n    total demand of fever medicines\n  \n  \n    \n    infected population in age group\n  \n  \n    \n    personal demand in age group\n  \n  \n    \n    infection duration in age group\n  \n  \n    \n    daily personal demand in age group\n  \n  \n    P\n    total population in subdistrict\n  \n  \n    \n    infection rate\n  \n  \n    \n    fever symptom duration rate\n  \n  \n    \n    population distribution of age groups\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to better model the problem, our team make the following assumptions:\n\nThe demographic distribution(the proportion of residents of each age range) is identical throughout various neighboorhoods within the whole Jinshan sub-district. This should be valid as it is not very large and shouldn’t have major difference within the sub-district.\nWhen fever symptom appears, people take fever medicine with ingredients of Ibuprofen or acetaminophen of the same brand. Each pack consists of 24 pills. People take the medicine according to the guidance that adults and the elders take two pills per day and children take one pill per day. This assumption is to ensure that we can quantitively measure how many “packs” of medicine are needed without losing generalizability. Our model can be easily adjusted to different kinds of medicines with minor modifications in calculation.\n\nTo calculate the total demand in the sub-district, we classify the resident into children, adults and the elders according to their ages, and then obtain their need of the medicines respectively. A complete demonstation of our model is below:\n\n\nWe first present how we calculate each part of the model, then wrap up the result in the next section.\nInfected Population in each Age GroupFrom the demographic information provided by WenXuJinShan(问需金山) WeChat Official Account, we can calculate the total population in Jinshan Subdistrict. Based on the survey in [1], the peak infection rate in an area is 63%. We multiply these two variables with corresponding age distribution proportion achieved through our questionaires to get the total infected population in this age group:\n​                                                                                        \nConsumption per PatientBased on [2], the total disease course of patients in each age group is:\nMeanwhile, the proportion of fever symptom duration within the total course is 21.2% by [3].We multiply these two variables with the amount of medicines taken by a person of the given age group in our assumption, we achieve the medicine demand of a single patient during the whole course of disease:\n\nFinal ResultFinally, we have access to the peak demand of fever medicine for each age group by multiplying infected popultion and medicine need of one patient calculated in previous procedures. We then add up the results of three age groups together to achieve the peak demand of number of packs of fever medicine in Jinshan Subdistrict.\n\n\n\nResult &amp; AnalysisAccording to the data and formula, we can obtain the result that . This means that for Jinshan subdistrict, whose population is about 270,000, the peak total demand of fever medicines is about 26,000 packs. \nAnd then we can analysis the result with some data collected from previous questionaires. There is a question about the interviewees’ willingness to buy fever medicines through several different access including hospital, online shopping, local fever clinic and drugstore. The result is clearly shown in the following pictures, and the conclusion can be drawn that residents in Jinshan subdistrict are willing to buy those medicines through various access, especially from drugstore and nearby fever clinic. So we can can obtain the peak demand that should be supplied by local fever clinic by calculating a proportion of fever clinic’s demand and multiply it with the total need of packs of fever medicines.\n\nSo, for the local fever clinic, totally preparing 7617 packs of fever medicine is enough to handle the peak demand in the subdistrict.\n\nFurther DiscussionBased on our previous discussions, we’ve successfully estimated the potential need when the pendamic reaches peak value. Actually, there’s more to do. Further research on this topic can be of various perspectives. \nFirst, we may transfer the estimation of the peak need into a complete respond plan in the future. The following picture[3] is the trend of infection in different countries in the past three years. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince January, 2022, the emerge of omicron variant of COVID-19 has caused the third and forth peak infection periods. This can actually serve as a good forecast of the future trend in China. The line chart above illustrates the Covid daily diagonized trend in six different countries. \nThe fight with COVID is a long-term journey. Our team sincerely hope that our project can serve as an inspiration of some potential actions for the Jingshan sub-district, and wish that we can all overcome this challenge.\n\nReference[1] 季爽, “多地公布新冠感染率调查数据：最高超60%！后续还有几波感染？,” M.gmw.cn, 2023. https://m.gmw.cn/baijia/2023-01/01/1303241015.html (accessed Jan. 10, 2023).\n[2] “上海会展中心方舱医院新型冠状病毒奥密克戎变异株感染者临床分析 - 中国知网,” kns.cnki.net. https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CAPJ&amp;dbname=CAPJLAST&amp;filename=RDYX20221116000&amp;uniplatform=NZKPT&amp;v=nSd8KGAxAJw-PQxf3wE3vImeH8Ac5b2I5X77NQr9J7iYifTtL8A8xGo6WSPVToSD (accessed Jan. 10, 2023).‌\n[3] Dong E, Du H, Gardner L.
