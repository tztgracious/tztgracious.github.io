In the new challenging circumstance, it’s undoubted that the residents in the community will try their best to store as much necessary fever medicine as possible. Major sources of medicine are local pharmacies, hospitals, and online shopping. Besides these sources, local fever clinics also play an important role in the supply of COVID medicines with ingredients like Ibuprofen and acetaminophen that are proven to be very useful to overcome fever symptoms. A deficit in these two kinds of medicine will cause severe problems and panic among the residents.\nMethod Introduction\nPopulation Heatmap of Jinshan Sub-district\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur team aims to quantitively measure the gap between the demand and the supply of these “fever medicines” at the peak stage of each pandemic wave so that the Jinshan sub-district(the place where we conduct our experiment) can have a better estimation of how much medicine should be prepared in each of its affiliated fever clinics in order to handle the vast demand.\n\nAnalysis on QuestionnaireBased on the question we define, we conduct a questionnaire survey on the demographic characteristics and people’s medicine purchase habits in the Jingshan sub-district. During the five-day survey, we collected a total of 170 effective samples. Now we present some of the major statistics results we concluded from the questionnaire.\nFamily size inquiry and kid/elder ratio\n\n\n\n\nBy applying NumPy and Pandas methods, we clean the data set collected from the questionnaires. Then we easily manipulate the data and get the bar chart above indicating the distribution of the household number. As we can infer from the figure, the number of 4 household people occupies the most proportion. While 5,3 and 6 households rank after it sequentially.\n\n\n\n\nThe results imply that the size of most families in the Jinshan Subdistrict falls into the scope from 3 to 6. Furthermore, from the dynamic chart, we can infer that a large proportion of these kinds of families have either kids or elders. The proportion of elders and kids in all the families, 0.2507 and 0.2973 respectively, will be used later in calculating the need for fever medicine.\nAwareness of free medicine delivery and options to get fever medicine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asking the survey takers whether they’d heard of the free medicine delivery, 78.8% of them respond that they’d never heard of it. While 18.8% of them have known it before without participation and only a proportion of 2.35% have known it with participation. To our surprise, we find out that the community actually has promoted this activity well, as the total ratio of people acknowledging it is over 21%. We reckon that time conflicts, unawareness of the activity time, and already enough fever medicine storage all contribute to the small proportion participating in it.\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart above illustrates the tendency to get fever medicine from different places. The discussion part will detail later.\nField Trip ResultTo investigate the actual supply ability in the region, we visited five pharmacies to survey their supply ability of various types of fever medicine in the infection wave. As most of the pharmacies cannot provide detailed data about their selling circumstance, we summarize the information we get in descriptive language:\n\nMost pharmacies don’t have strict statistics on the number of packs sold in a period of time, they just replenish periodically and sell whenever there is medicine remaining.\nPharmacies usually have a sufficient supply of compound medicine for colds like “999 cold spirit” even in peak infection period, while the important fever medicine with ingredients of Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are usually sold out for a long period of time in the infection wave.\nBased on the estimation of pharmacy salespeople, many people are used to storing the medicine even if they don’t need them currently. \nSalespeople estimated that the infection peak occurred in Fuzhou city occurred roughly in the middle of December. Previously mentioned medicine had been sold out even one week before that.\nOne salesperson at a pharmacy estimated that they sold roughly 100-200 packs during the infection wave before the medicine was sold out.\n\nThe result from both the questionnaire and the field trip meet our expectations. We can conclude that most people have a demand for extra medicine during the infection wave, and there’s a deficit of medicine in pharmacies. As pharmacy medicine replenishment is almost constant over time(they don’t get as much extra support as government-owned clinics and hospitals during the infection wave), our assumed problem is actually real and worth investigating.\n\nModel BuildingThe following table demonstrates some symbols and their meanings that will be used later.\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n  \n    Symbol\n    Meaning\n  \n\n\n  \n    D\n    total demand of fever medicines\n  \n  \n    \n    infected population in age group\n  \n  \n    \n    personal demand in age group\n  \n  \n    \n    infection duration in age group\n  \n  \n    \n    daily personal demand in age group\n  \n  \n    P\n    total population in subdistrict\n  \n  \n    \n    infection rate\n  \n  \n    \n    fever symptom duration rate\n  \n  \n    \n    population distribution of age groups\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to better model the problem, our team make the following assumptions:\n\nThe demographic distribution(the proportion of residents of each age range) is identical throughout various neighboorhoods within the whole Jinshan sub-district. This should be valid as it is not very large and shouldn’t have major difference within the sub-district.\nWhen fever symptom appears, people take fever medicine with ingredients of Ibuprofen or acetaminophen of the same brand. Each pack consists of 24 pills. People take the medicine according to the guidance that adults and the elders take two pills per day and children take one pill per day. This assumption is to ensure that we can quantitively measure how many “packs” of medicine are needed without losing generalizability. Our model can be easily adjusted to different kinds of medicines with minor modifications in calculation.\n\nTo calculate the total demand in the sub-district, we classify the resident into children, adults and the elders according to their ages, and then obtain their need of the medicines respectively. A complete demonstation of our model is below:\n\n\nWe first present how we calculate each part of the model, then wrap up the result in the next section.\nInfected Population in each Age GroupFrom the demographic information provided by WenXuJinShan(问需金山) WeChat Official Account, we can calculate the total population in Jinshan Subdistrict. Based on the survey in [1], the peak infection rate in an area is 63%. We multiply these two variables with the corresponding age distribution proportion achieved through our questionnaires to get the total infected population in this age group:\n\nConsumption per PatientBased on [2], the total disease course of patients in each age group is:\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;}.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}.tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n  \n    Age Group\n    Course of Disease (day)\n  \n\n\n  \n    Children\n    11.17\n  \n  \n    Adults\n    9.93\n  \n  \n    Elders\n    11.34\n  \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the proportion of fever symptom duration within the total course is 21.2% by [3]. We multiply these two variables by the number of medicines taken by a person of the given age group in our assumption, we achieve the medicine demand of a single patient during the whole course of the disease:\n\nFinal ResultFinally, we have access to the peak demand for fever medicine for each age group by multiplying the infected population and the medical need of one patient calculated in previous procedures. We then add up the results of three age groups together to achieve the peak demand for the number of packs of fever medicine in the Jinshan sub-district.\n\n\n\nResult &amp; AnalysisAccording to the data and formula, we can obtain the result that . This means that for the Jinshan subdistrict, whose population is about 240,000, the peak total demand for fever medicines is about 24,800 packs. \nAnd then we can analyze the result with some data collected from previous questionnaires. There is a question about the interviewees’ willingness to buy fever medicines through several different access including hospitals, online shopping, local fever clinic, and drugstore. The result is clearly shown in the following pictures, and the conclusion can be drawn that residents in the Jinshan subdistrict are willing to buy those medicines through various access, especially from drugstores and nearby fever clinics. So we can obtain the peak demand that should be supplied by local fever clinics by calculating the proportion of the fever clinic’s demand and multiplying it with the total need for packs of fever medicines.\n\nSo, for the local fever clinic, a total of preparing 7449 packs of fever medicine is enough to handle the peak demand in the subdistrict.\nAlso, we can predict the demand for fever medicines from other sources such as pharmacies, hospitals, and online shopping with the same method, and the results are listed in the following table.\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;}.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}.tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n  \n    Source\n    Demand (pack)\n  \n\n\n  \n    Clinic\n    7449.3\n  \n  \n    Pharmacy\n    8544.7\n  \n  \n    Online Shopping\n    4747.1\n  \n  \n    Hospital\n    3359.5\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Analysis &amp; DiscussionPotential Location of Additional Local Fever ClinicsBased on our previous discussions, we’ve successfully estimated the potential need when the pandemic reaches peak value. Actually, there’s more to do. Further research on this topic can be of various perspectives. \nFurthermore, we carry out a plan to help the subdistrict distribute the fever medicines to four existing local fever clinics based on the population differences between different communities. To further analyze this problem, we draw the following map and identify each community with an individual block.\n\n\nThen, we allocate each community to a local fever clinic according to the distance between them, classifying the communities into four types and expressing them into four different colors.\nTo calculate the demand in each local fever clinic, we can multiply the total demand in all local fever clinics by the proportion of its assigned resident’s number and get the following results:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the calculation result, it’s an obvious problem that ZhongTian fever clinic has to prepare too many medicines compared to the other three clinics, which may cause tremendous stress to one single clinic. However, if we want to average the demand, it is then unavoidable and unreasonable that some residents have to choose a farther local clinic to buy the fever medicines.\nTherefore, we think that it is a wise choice to add another local fever clinic in Xinzhu Community and reallocate some of the communities, which is depicted in the following map.\n\n\nThe final result shows that:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it is not a perfect scheme due to the limitation of the location of the previous four clinics, we still think it is a more balanced plan which can solve the problem of ZhongTian Community’s clinic’s huge stress.\nEstimation of Peak Infection Time IntervalWhile the result of our research is based on the current infection wave, we may also transfer the estimation of the peak need into a complete response plan in the future. The following picture[3] is the trend of infection in different countries in the past three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince January 2022, the emergence of the omicron variant of COVID-19 has caused the third and fourth peak infection periods. This can actually serve as a good forecast of the future trend in China. The line chart above illustrates the Covid daily diagnosed trend in six different countries. After investigating the first two peak dates in each country, we take the average and find the mean difference to be  days with a 95% confidence level. That’s roughly between 4 and 7 months. So we recommend the locals start storing fever medicine before this period.\nModel Analysis and Future Research TopicsDespite that our model gives a quantitive estimation of medicine shortage, improvements could also be done in various aspects.\nFirst, our model doesn’t consider the fact that people tend to store medicine even if they are not infected and the medicine is sold in pacts instead of single pills. Thus, the actual demand for packs should be higher than our estimation. A more comprehensive consideration could bring out a result with better accuracy.\nSecond, a more detailed survey of demographic information and the level of emergency in each community in the Jingshan sub-district can provide a better estimation of the demand. As we’re still undergoing the first infection wave, we lack enough time to conduct a more thorough survey for comprehensive analysis. We’ve also seen in the questionnaire that most residents are still unfamiliar with the free medicine giveaway activity, which also proves that local fever clinics lack enough attention while the medicine is sold out at other sources. Better propaganda of local clinics could relieve the pressure on pharmacies and large hospitals.\nThird, throughout the research of our team, we can see that the research on infection characteristics and numbers of omicron variants is still insufficient, which is the major trouble in our research. If we have more local infection data, much more research on various aspects could be conducted with tremendous advantages. \nThe fight against COVID is a long-term journey. Our team sincerely hopes that our project can serve as an inspiration for some potential actions for the Jingshan sub-district, and wish that we can all overcome this challenge.\n\nReference[1] 季爽, “多地公布新冠感染率调查数据：最高超60%！后续还有几波感染？,” M.gmw.cn, 2023. https://m.gmw.cn/baijia/2023-01/01/1303241015.html (accessed Jan. 10, 2023).\n[2] “上海会展中心方舱医院新型冠状病毒奥密克戎变异株感染者临床分析 - 中国知网,” kns.cnki.net. https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CAPJ&amp;dbname=CAPJLAST&amp;filename=RDYX20221116000&amp;uniplatform=NZKPT&amp;v=nSd8KGAxAJw-PQxf3wE3vImeH8Ac5b2I5X77NQr9J7iYifTtL8A8xGo6WSPVToSD (accessed Jan. 10, 2023).‌\n[3] Dong E, Du H, Gardner L.
